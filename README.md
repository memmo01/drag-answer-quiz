# Drag and Drop Quiz

A quiz that allows the user to drag the answers they think are correct into an area to be checked if it is a correct answer.


## Description

A quiz that populates questions and a set of answers to choose from. On desktop, the answers can be dragged into and out of the answer box. When the user is ready to submit their answer, they drag an answer to the answer box and select the submit button. If there are more questions in the array, it will move onto the next question for the user. When all questions have been answered, the results screen at the end of the quiz will display to the user how many answers they got correct and incorrect.

The drag and drop feature is for desktop only. However, this app is mobile responsive in design and function. On mobile, the functionality changes from drag and drop to clicking the correct answer. Once the selected answer is clicked, it will be displayed in the answer area. When the submit button is selected, it will submit the answer for review.



## Installation

Download the files and add questions/answers into the array located at the top of the script.js file (save file). Next open up the index.html file in the browser and quiz will begin.
